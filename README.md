YourLifeAlbum
================

Repository created to participate in the Photo Hack Day 2013 in Berlin developing YourLifeAlbum app


The idea of this app is to login in EyeEm, get all your photos and put them sorted by date 
in a calendar where you can navigate through the months and see them when you click on a day.
This functionality is done and works really good.

The goal was to use also another apis like G+ or Drive, but I hadn't enough time to do it.
